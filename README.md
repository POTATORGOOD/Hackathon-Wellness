# Hackathon-Wellness
Our project is a website that allows users to learn how to improve their physical and mental wellbeing. By using our surveys for info on mental and physical circumstances, you can find personalized results. However, there is general information given about relaxation tactics for mental health and workout routines for each muscle group as well.
